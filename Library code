            2. Plant your feet firmly on the ground and arch your back slightly to create a solid base for the movement.

            3. Grasp the barbell with a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and lift it off the rack.

            4. Lower the barbell to your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body.

            5. Pause for a moment and then press the barbell up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

            6. Repeat for the desired number of reps and sets.

            It's important to use proper form to avoid injury and maximize the benefits of the exercise. Keep your back flat on the bench and your feet planted firmly on the ground throughout the movement. Also, keep your head and glutes firmly on the bench, avoid arching your back too much.

            Additionally, make sure you are using the appropriate weight that you can handle while maintaining good form. It's always a good idea to have a spotter to assist you in case of any issues.
